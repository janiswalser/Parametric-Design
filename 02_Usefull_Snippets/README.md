# Usefull Snippets

As a lazy designer, I really like to collect and keep a library of useful code snippets that allow me to save a lot of time. Today, I have compiled a list of the some interesting snippets to boost up your process and creativity.

First of all, while I was running and executing scripts in MEL I felt crazy because every time I executed a new script â€“ the before created stuff was still in the canvas. 

Lets put this snippets alwas on top of every other line of code!

```
select -all;
delete;
```
